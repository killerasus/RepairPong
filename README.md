# RepairPong
Repair Pong for Global Game Jam 2020 made with [l√∂ve2d](http://love2d.org) and the project is managed with [loveman](https://nimble.itch.io/loveman)

## Game Idea
Like Pong, but your racket starts cracking from repeatedly blocking the ball. You must stop and repair.

## How to play
Currently the game is played by two players on the same keyboard.

'escape' - Exits current game to menu, and when in the menu, quits the program.
'spacebar' - Releases a new ball after a goal is made

### Player 1 (Left side)
'w' - Move up
's' - Move down
'x' - Repair paddle

### Player 2 (Right side)
'i' - Move up
'k' - Move down
'm' - Repair paddle
