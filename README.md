# RepairPong
Repair Pong for Global Game Jam 2020 made with [l√∂ve2d](http://love2d.org) and the project is managed with [loveman](https://nimble.itch.io/loveman)

## Game Idea
Like Pong, but your racket starts cracking from repeatedly blocking the ball. You must stop and repair.

## How to play
Currently the game is played by two players on the same keyboard.

`escape` - Exits current game to menu, and when in the menu, quits the program.
`spacebar` - Releases a new ball after a goal is made

| Command       | Player 1 (Left Side) | Player 2 (Right Side)  |
| ------------- |:--------------------:|:----------------------:|
| Move Up       | `w`                  | `i`                    |
| Move Down     | `s`                  | `k`                    |
| Repair Paddle | `x`                  | `m`                    |
